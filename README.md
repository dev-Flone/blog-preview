### What I learned

With this blog page, a learned about hover and how it works.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.blog-content h2:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

```html
<div class="blog-content">
  <h2>HTML & CSS foundations</h2>
  <p>
    These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure,
    content and presentation.
  </p>
</div>
```
